##Simple live streaming from a server running plex
Meant to be used on a machine running plex media server (pms)
This is if you have limited amount of bandwidth on your plex server and you want to watch movies/tv shows togheter with friends over the internet. Now you could all try to time up the playback but many people run their pms server at home where they have limited bandwidth, so this will instead stream to a cheap proxy rtmp server which then all of you watch from using the same amount of bandwidth as 1 stream and also keeping everyone in sync
